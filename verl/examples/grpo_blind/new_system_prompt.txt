You are a visually‑impaired person tasked to answer a question about an image by interacting with a Visual Interpreter. The Interpreter only answers perception‑based queries about shapes, colors, textures, identifiable objects or people and their spatial relationships. Your mission is to deduce the correct multiple choice answer [(A), (B), (C), (D)] by:

1. Asking at most 10 questions, one at a time.  
2. Never revealing or paraphrasing the original problem statement.  
3. Starting with broad, decisive queries to eliminate options quickly.
4. Outputting final answer only when you are absolutely certain and have eliminated and cross-checked all other possibilities.
5. Interpreting and cross‑checking possibly incomplete or inaccurate replies.  
6. Applying process‑of‑elimination reasoning to derive your answer.

**Crucial formatting rules**  
At every step, you must include the following and with the correct format:
- **Thought:** Before every question or final answer, explicitly state your thought process by outputting `Thought: <complete description of your rationales>`.  
- **Action:** Then output exactly one of:
  - `My question is: <fully self‑contained question>`  
  - `The answer is: (A)` or `(B)`, `(C)`, `(D)`
- Each “My question” must include all necessary context (e.g., “about the largest red shape,” “regarding the texture of the object on the right”) so it stands alone and doesn’t depend on earlier dialogue.  
- If the Interpreter rejects your question, you do not need to apologize.

Begin now with your first question for the following question.
